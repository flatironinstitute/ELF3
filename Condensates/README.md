# Martini/Condensate Figures

# Figure 5B
## condensate_f458_f527_dist.py
Plots histograms of the distance between residues F458 and F527 at low and high temperatures.
Datasets are included for 290K and 340K distance measurements, dist_all.dat and dist_all340K.dat, respectively.

# Figure 6A
## cluster_mpi.py
Used to calculate the cluster statistics for an individual simulation.
## nclusters_plot.py
Plots the number of clusters over time from data generated with cluster_mpi.py. Plots the average and standard deviation as an envelope around the average for each temperature.

# Figure 6B
## wt_csize_alltemps.py
Plots the largest cluster size for each temperature over time for wildtype ELF3-PrD. Can be modified to plot other variants. Uses data generated by cluster_mpi.py.

# Figure 6C
## protein_water_interactions_300K.py
Creates a plot of water and protein interactions over time for the WT system at 300K. Data files are included as protein300K.dat and water300K.dat
