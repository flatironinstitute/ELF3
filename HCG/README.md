## hcg_pc1_2col.py
Plots E-PC1 of HCG 0Q/7Q/13Q/19Q at 290K (left) and 415K (right). Code does not align data, data files must be pre-processed to achieve this.  

## Fig. 4:
## hcg_sasa.py
Plots separate SASA plot for each HCG 0Q/7Q/13Q/19Q ensembles at 290K (no difference between temperatures). 
PolyQ tracts are highlighted in blue and a dashed black line denotes the average SASA value of the system.

## hcg_ipca.py
I-PCA PC1 and PC2 plots of all HCG ensmbles. 8 subplots in a 2 column x 4 row configuration.

## hcg_epca_rev.py

Plots 8 sets of E-PCA data. Currently plots PC1 290K and PC2 290K for each system. All data files are avaiable in HCG_EPCA_data directory.

## hcg_sasa.py
Solvent accessible surface area for all polyQ lengths. 4 row x 1 column, only 290K plotted because all temperatures are essentially identical. 
PolyQ region is shaded blue.


## rg_hcg.py
Histogram of 7Q temperature-dependent radius of gyration.
