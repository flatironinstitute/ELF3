# HCG Figures

# Figure 1B
## ss_7q_alltemp_helix.py
Plots helix probablity per residue for 7Q HCG ensembles at all temperatures.

# Figure 4A:
## hcg_sasa.py
Plots separate SASA plot for each HCG 0Q/7Q/13Q/19Q ensembles at 290K (no difference between temperatures). 
PolyQ tracts are highlighted in blue and a dashed black line denotes the average SASA value of the system.

# Figure S10A:
## hcg_epca_rev.py
Plots 8 sets of E-PCA data. Currently plots PC1 290K and PC2 290K for each system. All data files are avaiable in HCG_EPCA_data directory.
