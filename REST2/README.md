# REST2 Figures
# Fig 2A, 2B & 2C:
## dssp_wt_f527a_0q.py
Plot of 7Q, F527A and 0Q helicity, including all temperatures, of REST2 trajectories. Creates three subplots vertically stacked. Highlights Haro, F96 and 3 polyQ tracts.
# Fig. 2E
## sasa_rmsf.py
Plots the SASA and RMSF values of the WT and F527A mutant at 290K.

# Fig. 2F
## rg_nterm_cterm.py 
Plots the RG of the first 100 residues and athe last 73 residues as histograms. Top panel is WT REST, bottom panel is F527A.

# Fig 3A:
## dist_f527a_haro.py
Histograms of F527-Haro minimum distance for each temperature condition. WT REST2.

# Fig 3B:
## kde_plot_haro_rg.py
Script used to create Figs 3B. This script only creates one plot and must be modified and rerun to create the whole figure.

# Fig. 4B
## 1stpeak.py
Plots the max value of the first peak of the rdf curve for each residue. 7Q REST2 at 290K is blue and 405K is red. 
Haro highlighted in yellow, polyQ in blue. Does not calculate peak heights, those must be provided as input data.
